# Competition (rank:350/1720): Binary Classification problem of a program containing defects or not according to twenty features
## Use of ensemble classifiers 
Does using linear convex combination of ensemble classifiers improve the prediction score?  
With two ensemble models it improves.
# When adding a model is not that useful, what should I do?
It depends on cross validation score ! 
use of climbing hill algorithm for determining weight in an ensemble prediction.
